we use the split out data from the many documents we processed
we use the categorisation to record relationships between the "concepts" and "document subtitles" and their content
we use python to automatically establish this information into a graph database, which will be the really powerful bit
the graph database can absorb further relationships and adapt to new factors that we think are important
all this is already automated
